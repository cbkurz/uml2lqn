# Epsilon
Epsilon is embedded in the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and provides languages to work with the models defined in EMF/Ecore. 
The languages provided depend on the Epsilon Object Language (EOL), which allows one to navigate through models. 
With the languages provided and the integration into the Eclipse IDE, Epsilon strongly supports Model Driven Engineering (MDE). 
To get an understanding of the Epsilon framework, see the following resources:
* https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/ - the main page of Epsilon
* https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/playground/ - provides an in-browser-environment to create models
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRwHao6Ue0YUecg7vEUQTrtySIWwrd_mI - is a lecture on how to use Epsilon in a course by Dimitris Kolovos.
